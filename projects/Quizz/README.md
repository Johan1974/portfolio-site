# Quiz Game

Welcome to the **Quiz Game**! This is an interactive Python-based quiz that allows you to test your knowledge with True/False questions on various topics. This project is part of **Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code** training, aimed at helping learners build Python projects while learning coding fundamentals.

## Overview

The Quiz Game is designed to be an engaging way to challenge yourself. The game presents a series of questions, each with a True or False answer. Your score is tracked throughout the quiz, and the final result is displayed at the end.

## Features

- **Engaging Quiz Format**: Answer True or False to a variety of interesting questions.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Your score is updated as you progress through the game.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: The game is easy to play directly from the terminal with minimal setup.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The game is built using Python, a versatile and powerful programming language.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project leverages classes to handle the logic for questions, scoring, and quiz management.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several key files:

- **main.py**: The main entry point that controls the flow of the game.
- **question_model.py**: Defines the `Question` class, which holds the question text and the correct answer.
- **data.py**: Contains a collection of quiz questions and answers.
- **quiz_brain.py**: Manages the quiz's logic, keeping track of the score and ensuring questions are presented in order.

## How to Play

To run the quiz game locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
